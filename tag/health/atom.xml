        <title>The Tyranny of Emotions</title>
        <link rel="alternate" href="http://davembush.github.com/the-tyranny-of-emotions/"/>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Emotions are a weird element of being human.  They can propel us forward or hold us back.  Sometimes they are violent.  Most of the time they whisper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several events have occurred recently that have me thinking about this more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start with, I’ve started paying more attention to my health.  There were a lot of things holding me back from this in the past.  It turns out, most of what was holding me back was just a lie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve started interviewing again.  The nature of what I do means I get to do this a lot.  You’d think I’d get used to it.  But, I don’t like the interview process.  I don’t like changing jobs.  I really don’t like code interviews.  But, I do them because I like to program for a living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for those of you who know me, just because I’m interviewing doesn’t mean I don’t like where I am and have any intention of leaving.  I interview when I have work so I still have the skill when I don’t have work.  And who knows?  I may just find something I like better than where I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the interviews I’ve been on have revealed that managers think in similar short-term ways that I have.  Short-term thinking is so easy to see when it is someone else. &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/uploads/2017/08/2017-08-19.png&#34; title=&#34;The Tyranny of Emotions&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Photo credit: &lt;a href=&#34;//www.flickr.com/photos/whinmobzappmedia/16016836686/&#34;&gt;whinmobzappmedia&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=&#34;//visualhunt.com/re/fb1f6a&#34;&gt;VisualHunt&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#x2F; &lt;a href=&#34;//creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/&#34;&gt; CC BY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span id=&#34;more&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;Health&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#Health&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;Health&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was under the misconception that if I paid more attention to my health, it would take time away from things I would rather be doing.  As it turns out, paying attention to my health has more than made up for the time it has taken. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was “afraid” of being uncomfortable.  I admit it.  I’m generally a pain wimp.  I wasn’t looking forward to sweating.  But it turns out, you get use to stuff like that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the question to ask here is, “what was it that was keeping me from trying and what was it that got me started?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a word, fear.  I was afraid I was going to lose the ability to do things that I considered more fun.  I was afraid of the discomfort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the thing that got me started was slowly being exposed to the many benefits of living a slightly healthier life style.  I can’t say when exactly I started thinking I might want to make some changes, but I can tell you the first step was asking myself, “what can I do that is sustainable?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve learned, “what can I do?” is the best question I can ask when all that is being offered are reasons why something can’t happen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out, the answer to that question was, “if you got a tread mill, you could start walking every morning in the comfort of your own home.  You wouldn’t have to go outside when it is too hot or too cold.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve also learned that walking every morning is a medically proven way to reduce the chances of getting cancer, reduce cholesterol, lower my resting heart rate, improve my confidence, improve brain function, reduce depression and help me sleep better. With all of those benefits, why wouldn’t I walk every morning? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to starting to walk every morning, I had already started to focus on my diet.  I’m not particularly over-weight.  I’m just over-weight for me.  So, I started on a high fat diet.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately, I’ve worked in MCT oil, some super food supplements as well as some magnesium oil, and reduced my caffeine intake to the first two hours of my day.  Between this and the walking, I actually have more time in my day and I don’t feel nearly as tired by the end of the work day as I had been. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the more I focus on my health, the more I want to focus on my health because I’ve found that most of the stuff holding me back from even starting were lies and half-truths.  Not to mention momentum and addictions to unhealthy foods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a super tip for anyone who is interested in this stuff.  Diet isn’t about will power.  If you are playing the will-power game, you are going to lose.  Your current life-style is formed on food addictions (with the help of food companies) emotions and occasionally the belief that you can’t afford to eat healthy.  The dirty little secret is, if you eat healthy and figure out what the emotional triggers are, the addictions practically take care of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;Interviewing&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#Interviewing&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;Interviewing&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Interviewing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been a contract programmer most of my career.  By definition, most of the places I’ve worked have been about a year and a half long and then I move on.  There are exceptions, but that is the general rule.  And let’s just say that my career has been nice and long.  So, you’d think at some point I would get used to interviewing and switching jobs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I haven’t.  I’ve never liked new.  And, every job is new.  Every interview is new. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the thing I dislike the most is that interviewing is a game that I don’t think anyone has figured out.  The strong temptation is to tell the person interviewing you what you think they want to hear.  I’ve found I do better if I tell them what I actually believe. If they don’t like the answer, I figure I probably wouldn’t be happy working there anyhow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there is the code interview.  I’ve talked about this several times on this blog before.  I still don’t think it is a good measure of what I can bring to an organization.  But, with all of the “programmers” who can’t do the simple stuff, I acknowledge they are probably necessary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the problem with code interviews is that they are “test” constructed by other programmers, not by a professional testing organization.  This means that the first thing I have to figure out about the question is, “what are you really asking me?”  Also, you can never be quite sure what they are testing for.  Do they just want to see that you can solve the problem?  Do they have a particular implementation they are expecting from you?  Do they care about the answer at all and they are just using the code portion of the interview to weed out people who can’t code at all?  And if they are looking for a particular answer, how can they be so sure they have the “right” answer and that my answer is “wrong?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, I was once asked how .NET memory management works.  The official answer is, “there is nothing in the .NET specification that says how it should work at all.”  But, the way it has been implemented in Windows is typically the answer people are looking for.  I’ve learned the best answer is the full answer.  Then again, why is this something anyone cares about.  Memory gets managed.  That should be all you really need to know. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all of these problems, why do I continue on? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, as I’ve mentioned in other post, hopefully, I’ll learn something with each interview.  I’ll either learn something about myself, or I’ll learn some bit of programming that I still need to work on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, the growth experience of doing something hard has benefit too.  If I avoid hard stuff, I learn that hard stuff is bad.  If I do hard stuff, I learn that hard stuff is just hard.  It won’t kill me.  Besides, I can’t even say what it is about new stuff that scares me.  It is just that feeling.  And I need to silence that lizard.  This is one reason why I believe in interviewing even if you have a job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve worked with people in the past who won’t do code interviews.  They say things like, “I have thirty years of experience, if that’s not good enough for you, I don’t want to work for you.”  And I get it.  But I think secretly, they’re afraid of doing the interview.  I always ask, “why not just do the interview?  The worse that can happen is you don’t get the gig, and you might learn something in the process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;Hiring-Managers&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#Hiring-Managers&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;Hiring Managers&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Hiring Managers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve hit this one at several levels.  Mostly I deal with recruiters.  Most of the recruiters I deal with are just looking for warm bodies.  Having dealt with them on both ends, as a person conducting interviews and as the one looking for work, I can tell you the market is saturated with the “any warm body” variety of recruiter. I’ve started filtering out the “any warm body” recruiters from my email and only work with recruiters that work with companies that are looking for programmers at a level above that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hit this in full force this week when I did a phone interview with a lady who works for a company that has a pool of remote developers who work on their client’s programs.  So when we started talking about rate I found out that they pay everyone the same because it makes the math easier for the owner. I don’t know about you but that sounds short sighted at best and like slave labor at its worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve interviewed at other places where they seemed more concerned with what they would have me work on than IF they wanted to hire me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get that the hiring process is difficult, and figuring out my worth might be difficult.  But, let’s take a look at this for a bit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s just say you have 10 programmers who you pay $100K a year each.  You are interviewing someone who can demonstrate that they are twice as productive AND that they’ll be able to improve the productivity of everyone else you already have by at least 10% simply by being on your team, mentoring your existing staff, and implementing process improvements to your organization.  How much value does this 11th programmer possess?  Simple math would indicate at least $200K. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, fear holds us back, does it not?  All we hear is that this programmer is asking for a salary that is 1.5 times as much as what you’re paying everyone else and think, “I can’t afford that.”  The reality is, you probably can’t afford to NOT hire them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine if you found a diamond mine in a field that was worth $1,000,000 and the land you found the mine in was being sold for $700,000 wouldn’t you find some way to buy the field? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you don’t have $700,000.  And you think, “I can’t afford that.”  But isn’t a better question, “how can I afford that?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;Conclusion&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#Conclusion&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;Conclusion&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, my challenge this week is, “Don’t let fear hold you back.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look for a way.  Stop listening to the whispers in your head telling you something can’t be done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do something hard today and improve by 1%.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How To Be an Awesome Programmer</title>
        <link rel="alternate" href="http://davembush.github.com/how-to-be-an-awesome-programmer/"/>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It isn’t what you think.  Being an awesome programmer, or being awesome at anything has a lot less to do with any given topic: programming, boxing, writing.  It has a lot to do with being a healthy human.  So, the simple answer to the question of “How to be an awesome programmer” is simply, “be healthy.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what does healthy look like? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really couldn’t tell you what got me started, but I’ve been reading an experimenting with Brain Hacks, Diet, Exercise, and Social Skills for over a year now.  Turns out, they are all related. Now, most of my audience has less than 5 years of experience.  I can say that because most of the programming population has less than 5 years of experience, so I’m going on the assumption that the people who read this blog, are a small representation of the global population.  Many symptoms I will reference are going to be things you may not suffer with … yet.  If you fall in that group, think of this post as a letter from your older self.  I was young once too.  I remember, I thought I was immune to some of these issues and if I wasn’t, there wasn’t much I could do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we’ve learned SO much in the last 20 years.  Much of what we’ve thought was “normal” really isn’t.  We are just proverbial frogs in a pan of water being heated to death. &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/uploads/2017/07/2017-07-11.jpg&#34; title=&#34;How To Be an Awesome Programmer&#34;&gt; Photo via &lt;a href=&#34;//visualhunt.com/re/4bde52&#34;&gt;VisualHunt.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span id=&#34;more&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;h2 id=&#34;Disclaimer&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#Disclaimer&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;Disclaimer&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the stuff I’m going to talk about in here is what I’ve learned and from my experience.  I’m a programmer.  Not a doctor, Jim.  I write this in the hopes that it helps at least one other person.  But, I also leave the research and due diligence to you.  Just like I could give you some general programming guidance, but I would expect you to dig for more details.  Not that I do that intentionally when I write about programming.  Just be aware that I’m definitely not giving details here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, there is this funny little thing called “reactance” that causes us to want to believe that what we currently believe is the right way.  So, I’m going to ask you a simple little question.  It is the one I try to implement every time I hear a new idea.  “What if they are right?  What if I am wrong?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is, just because you are used to living a certain way, doesn’t make it the right way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;Brain-Health&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#Brain-Health&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;Brain Health&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Brain Health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, as I’ve thought about what I want to write, I could literally start from just about any angle.  The cool thing about our bodies is that they are SO intertwined.  When one system gets out of whack, other systems in the body fail as well.  But I wanted to start with Brain Health because if you can hack that, it seems most of the other stuff we should be doing becomes quite a bit easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;Sleep&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#Sleep&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;Sleep&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Sleep&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, our first stop in brain health is sleep.  There are a lot of hacks that you can implement to get better sleep, but if you are going to be late and getting up early so that you are in bed for less than 8 hours, you are already starting out in a bad place.  I’ve always been pretty good at sleeping.  But there was a time when I was trying to cram more useful day out of my 24 hours so I was getting up an hour earlier than I currently do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I developed aching shoulder muscles that I caulked up to a change in office chairs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I changed sleep habits.  I decided I didn’t really need that extra hour.  Almost immediately, my shoulders stopped aching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;Food&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#Food&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;Food&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Food&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talking about food is like talking about religion.  People have some very strongly held beliefs.  I’m guessing you do too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, before I try to break through some myths, let’s address where our current beliefs about how to eat “right” come from. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid, we had the “4 square meal.”  Equal portions of different categories of food.  Then, it was a REALLY big deal when USDA came out with the “Food pyramid.”  And now we have a “food plate.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can you believe that any one of those is “right” when they’ve changed so often?  Either our research is flawed, or something else is influencing the changes.  They sure aren’t reliable.  And, we want to believe them because an “authority” says they are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you something about “authorities.”  They aren’t all knowing and sometimes, they are wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing that sticks with me is something a psychologist (employer) of mine told me.  “The schools are at least 20 years behind the research.”   WOW!  This means that your doctor is recommending things he learned 20+ years ago.  And it gets worse.  With lawsuits as prevalent as they are and insurance companies in control, few doctors are going to tell you what the current research says about what you should be eating, even if they know.  The “system” moves slowly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, it doesn’t take long to find information on the Internet that supports the following basic food truths:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay away from sugar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay away from carbs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eat more fat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve heard it before.  Probably from some diet thing.  But, did you know that eating primarily carbs and sugars, as we’ve been doing now for over a generation, also makes us dumber?! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I’ve been on a basically ketogenic diet for several years now.  Up until recently, I struggled with the temptation of eating foods on the naughty list.  There are two things that turned that around for me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I realized that the foods that held the strongest temptation had some emotional trigger or event tied to them.  But, in truth, I didn’t REALLY like the food. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, I increased the amount of fat in my diet.  Now, I crave vegetables.  And as an added bonus, I don’t eat as many calories and I’m almost never hungry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, what does this have to do with brain health?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that your brain is mostly fat.  And not just any fat, but the kind of fat you’ll find in butter, coconut oil, olive oil, and meat.  There is still “bad fat” but it is the fat that is manmade.  Margarine, and corn oil for example.  Anyhow, if you remove good fat from your diet, your brain doesn’t function as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, there are studies that indicate that a lot of brain disease is caused by a lack of fat in our diets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbs are bad.  Fats are good.  Check it out for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;Exercise&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#Exercise&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;Exercise&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Exercise&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next thing that heavily influences brain health is exercise.  Yes, it helps for dieting too.  But, that’s not the only benefit.  And only certain kinds of exercise is beneficial to exercise.  But the simple act of walking for 30 minutes every day 6 days a week, has several brain healthy benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improves confidence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helps fight depression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improves sleep (which also helps your brain)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduces stress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generally improves cognition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a simple thing to do that has so many benefits that using the excuse, “I’m too busy to exercise.” Is just that.  An excuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;Cortisol-and-Oxytocin&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#Cortisol-and-Oxytocin&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;Cortisol and Oxytocin&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Cortisol and Oxytocin&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cortisol is the hormone that is triggered by stress.  It isn’t all bad.  But the amount we generally live with is bad.  The thing about Cortisol is that it can wreck your diet.  You’ve been trying to shed pounds but you’ve reached a floor.  It could be you are under too much stress.  Maybe because you aren’t getting enough sleep.   Or maybe you’ve just forgotten how to relax.  Or, it could be you aren’t eating correctly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxytocin, on the other hand, is the “feel good” drug.  There are a lot of ways to increase this and the great news is, no one has yet run a study that has concluded you can get too much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And once again, what is generally bad for our general health is directly linked to our brain health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;Breath&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#Breath&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;Breath&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Breath&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This one kind of surprised me.  Just doing nothing more than focusing on your breath for 10 minutes a day, lowers cortisol and has many other health benefits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you’ll see this phrased as “meditation” which kind of freaks some people out.  So, don’t meditate.  Just go to a quiet place and focus on breathing.  If you want to move it up a notch focus on breathing and relaxing on the exhale. 10 minutes a day.  Who doesn’t have time for that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;Ask-Good-Questions&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#Ask-Good-Questions&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;Ask Good Questions&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Ask Good Questions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, when I mention some of my practices to people I work with, I’m invariably met with, “I could never do that.”  Which reminds me of what my dad always said, “Can’t went to the poor house and died.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is, if you think you can’t, you surely won’t.  I won’t go so far as to say, “If you think you can or you think you can’t, in either case you are right.”  But, thinking you can will lead you to asking the right question and will at least get you closer to “there” where ever that may be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some questions for you to ponder: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can I get the right amount of sleep? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can I get good quality sleep? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is keeping me from sleeping? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can I eat healthier? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What foods will help me? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What foods will hurt me? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What in my environment needs to change?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;Resources&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#Resources&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;Resources&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’d put resources here of stuff I’ve read.  But I want you to do the research.  If I give it to you, you are a lot less likely to put it into action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I want to ask you a few questions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen, I know you are reluctant to change.  I get that.  I really do.  But if you were to change even just a few of your habits, what might some of the benefits be for you? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a scale of 1 to 10, how likely are you to investigate some of the changes mentioned above? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why didn’t you rate it lower? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine you’ve investigated the changes and implemented them, what kind of impact would that have on your life? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is that important to you? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, what are you going to do about this next?&lt;/p&gt;
